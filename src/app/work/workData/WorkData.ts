      "We developed and deployed a scalable IoT Data Logging System for a leading battery manufacturer in the EV auto space. The system captures real-time, time-series data such as location, voltage, current, and temperature from thousands of EV autos across India. This data is pushed to our cloud platform, which generates actionable diagnostic reports to identify performance issues—especially in response to range complaints. The platform has become a critical diagnostic tool and is now deployed across thousands of vehicles.",
